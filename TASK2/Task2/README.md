# Vehicle Parking Detection System - Edge Deployment
## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent vehicle parking detection system that classifies parking spaces as occupied or vacant using computer vision. The system leverages YOLOv11 fine-tuned on the PKLot dataset and is deployed as a Flask web service with ONNX runtime optimization for edge computing scenarios.

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Approach
Edge Framework Selection
ONNX Runtime: Chosen for cross-platform compatibility and optimized inference
Flask: Lightweight web framework for rapid deployment
OpenCV: Efficient image/video processing pipeline
Optimization Techniques Implemented

## Model Conversion: PyTorch â†’ ONNX format conversion

# Model export to ONNX
```bash
model.export(format='onnx', optimize=True)
Quantization: Applied INT8 quantization to reduce model size by ~75%
```


# Dynamic quantization for reduced memory footprint
```bash
quantized_model = quantize_dynamic(model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8)
```
Input Preprocessing Optimization:

Batch processing for multiple detections
Optimized image resizing and normalization
Memory-efficient data loading
Inference Pipeline Optimization:

Multi-threading for concurrent request handling
Connection pooling for database operations
Caching mechanism for repeated requests
